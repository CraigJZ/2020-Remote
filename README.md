# 2020 Ruby For Good - Remote

We do most of our coordination and planning for our projects on slack. Grab an invite to our slack channel [here](https://rubyforgood.herokuapp.com). After joining slack ping `polly`, `sean`, `tundal45`, `MK McKenzie`, `jtu` or one of the slack contacts below with any questions on projects that could use some assistance. Or just jump to their repos and look for open issues!

### CASA

Each day 8,775 incidents of child abuse and neglect are reported nationwide and approximately 1,188 children are removed from their homes and placed in foster care or residential treatment centers. Today, at least three children will die as a result of abuse and neglect. Though awareness of this national issue is increasing, it is important to remember that abuse and neglect effects all communities.

**C**ourt **A**ppointed **S**pecial **A**dvocate (**CASA**) is a volunteer based organization that partners with the juvenile court to improve the lives of abused and neglected children living in foster care. These extraordinary volunteer advocates work one-on-one with children, getting to know them, talking to the important people in their lives, working to understand them, not just their legal case. These volunteer advocates then go to Court with them, not only to hold their hand but to advocate for them. They provide written and oral reports to the Court that
protect children’s fundamental right to live in safety.

As do gooders, we will be helping to build a brand new volunteer portal for CASA. Given there are chapters of CASA throught the continental US, this project will definitely need to embrace multi-tenancy. We will need both JavaScript and Rails developers!

### Pinto Abalone

Abalones are marine mollusks that were once hunted nearly to extinction, and are slowly making a comeback thanks to diligent conservancy efforts.  Abalone conservationists release captive-bred animals to bolster wild populations -- but how do they know which animal pairings will make the most and hardiest abalone babies, or reduce inbreeding dangers?  Your code will directly support these conservancy challenges!

From a technical standpoint, we'll be building on existing work for one subspecies, and our challenges will include multi-tenancy.  Who doesn't love a good multi-tenancy project under their belt?  We need both JavaScript and Rails developers.

### Diaperbase

Each month over 350,000 children are helped by diaper banks, forgoing their parents having to make the difficult choice of choosing between feeding their children and putting diapers on them. There are diaper banks in 44 states and they provide about 4 million diapers a month to needy families. We're going to be using the SaaS that we built last year, making it more robust, and polishing it off to be demoed at the National Diaperbank Network conference later this year. Our goal is for this one to be the best Inventory management product available at the lowest (or "no") cost to diaperbanks. We will be working in tandem with PartnerBase, which is a CRM for Community Partners that will work with the Diaperbanks to handle distribution / order fulfillment /family interaction.

### Free Forest School
What if kids could learn while playing outdoors?  They can!  Research shows unstructured play is greatly beneficial to children's development.  Free Forest School organizes local chapters to support children explore and learn while outdoors.

Our project will help parents and teachers (or maybe even kids!) find Free Forest School service areas wherever they might be.  We're going to use Mapbox, so if you've ever wanted to learn some GIS work with your Rails and/or JavaScript, or played hooky to be in the great outdoors, this project is for you!

### TerraStories

Indigenous people have lived in the Amazon rainforest in South America for thousands of years, and continue to do so today. Nearly two-fifth of the Amazon region is settled by indigenous and other traditional communities, who live sustainably off the forest and its natural resources. Many of today’s communities have lived in their territories for centuries, and have an intimate relationship with their ancestral lands. Community members share a richly detailed knowledge about places like sacred, spiritual and historical sites, which can count up to hundreds in number and comprise an incredible geography central to the communities’ collective identity. But this traditional knowledge is primarily transmitted orally, and in the contemporary era is at risk of disappearing forever. To prevent this from happening, the Amazon Conservation Team (ACT) is partnering with the indigenous people of the Amazon to map their lands and record oral history storytelling. ACT is training youth to use mapping technologies and interview their elders so they can preserve their cultural and historical legacy for future generations to come. Using the latest tools in web mapping, we can visualize these recordings by placing them on an interactive map. However, in order to bring this back to the communities in the rainforest, we need a geostorytelling portal that can function entirely in an offline setting. ACT will use TerraStories for its active oral histories projects with partner communities, but the application will be entirely open source and shared with any community who wants to document their own place-based storytelling. We'll be focusing on building out reusability for other communities and organizations to use the system.
