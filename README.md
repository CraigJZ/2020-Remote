# 2020 Ruby For Good - Remote

### Communicating with us

We do most of our coordination and planning for our projects on slack. Grab an invite to our slack channel [here](https://rubyforgood.herokuapp.com). After joining slack ping `craig`, `gia` `polly`, `sean` or one of the slack contacts below with any questions on projects that could use some assistance. Or just jump to their repos and look for open issues!

### CASA

Each day 8,775 incidents of child abuse and neglect are reported nationwide and approximately 1,188 children are removed from their homes and placed in foster care or residential treatment centers. Today, at least three children will die as a result of abuse and neglect. Though awareness of this national issue is increasing, it is important to remember that abuse and neglect effects all communities.

**C**ourt **A**ppointed **S**pecial **A**dvocate (**CASA**) is a volunteer based organization that partners with the juvenile court to improve the lives of abused and neglected children living in foster care. These extraordinary volunteer advocates work one-on-one with children, getting to know them, talking to the important people in their lives, working to understand them, not just their legal case. These volunteer advocates then go to Court with them, not only to hold their hand but to advocate for them. They provide written and oral reports to the Court that
protect childrenâ€™s fundamental right to live in safety.

As do gooders, we will be helping to build a brand new volunteer portal for CASA. Given there are chapters of CASA throught the continental US, this project will definitely need to embrace multi-tenancy. We will need both JavaScript and Rails developers!

### Diaperbase

Each month over 350,000 children are helped by diaper banks, forgoing their parents having to make the difficult choice of choosing between feeding their children and putting diapers on them. There are diaper banks in 44 states and they provide about 4 million diapers a month to needy families. We're going to be using the SaaS that we built last year, making it more robust, and polishing it off to be demoed at the National Diaperbank Network conference later this year. Our goal is for this one to be the best Inventory management product available at the lowest (or "no") cost to diaperbanks. We will be working in tandem with PartnerBase, which is a CRM for Community Partners that will work with the Diaperbanks to handle distribution / order fulfillment /family interaction.
